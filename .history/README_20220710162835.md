### Links
- Live Site URL: (https://sunny-side-marketing.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript



### What I learned

 With this website, I was able to make my webpage responsive by starting with a mobile first designs. Initially, I began learning layouts with floats, then transitioned to Flexbox. In this project, I was able to get my hands dirty with CSS Grid and for the desktop layout complete that with floats.

I learned that I can still utilize flexbox properties on items inside of CSS grid to help align content and more! This is thefirst website that I made that is responsive for both mobile and desktop devices.


### Continued development

I would like to continue to work with making sites with mobile first designs and ensure that in the future I am including tablets in my designs.
